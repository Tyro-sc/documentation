<div class="paragraph">
<p>The goal of this document is to provide comprehensive reference documentation for developers, analysts or QA who want to write User Interface tests with <strong>Tyro</strong>.
It also explains how to write good UI tests scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction">Introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> is a web user interface testing tool providing a framework to test any html5 application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What makes it stand out from the crowd is its beautiful and highly expressive language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> provides, on one hand, an abstraction of the UI business domain through an expressive API and, on the other hand, a way to express this domain via a DSL (a button semantically stays a button, whatever the technology).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With <strong>Tyro</strong>, you can therefore write tests with a seldom achieved level of expressiveness and make those tests INDEPENDENT of the underlying technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> is built on top of the <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">WebDriver</a> browser automation library, which means that Tyro can work with any browser that WebDriver supports.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> plays very well with <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/">JUnit</a>, <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a>, <a href="https://gauge.org/">Gauge</a> and many others testing tools.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_why_tyro_is_unique">Why Tyro is unique</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> is the result of numerous real-world observations of developers in the trenches in the area of GUI testing.
Working for many years to promote the <strong>TDD/BDD</strong> approaches, we often faced difficulties in their implementation for the graphical layer of applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong>"TEST FIRST"</strong> principle excludes all scenario recorder based approaches that only allow you to write tests as a second thought.
Our experience has taught us that this path is a dead-end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another problem is UI tests are brittle and costly! We do think that this is due to the lack of abstraction in existing UI testing tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, <strong>Tyro</strong> can transform tests in real assets, present throughout the lifecycle of the application and always in tune with the latest version of the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Tyro</strong> is an opinionated tool. It forces the user to see and use the domain layer as a composition and aggregation of UI components (in Tyro, everything is a UI component).</p>
